# Data Analysis

First of all, we would analyze how similar our color & style matching data (from HIT 1-2 and HIT 1-2) is to the pieces the crowdworkers provide through links. For each link provided, we would determine whether it has the same color or same style. Out of all the links provided, we would compare the number of inputs that match the data provided and fresh inputs.

Moreover, we would compare the final selection rate (rank top 3 from HIT 3) of pieces that match the color & style matching data and pieces that do not. This would give us meaningful information of how much the data from HIT 1-1 and HIT 1-2 is effective. 

Also, by comparing the number of tops, bottoms, and dresses people upload for a matching, we will provide more data and styles for the most chosen article.
